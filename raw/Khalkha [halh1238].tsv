Exceptions from this are formed by the reciprocal, cooperative and pluritative voices, which inherently imply and require a plural subject. The reciprocal (mutual action) and the cooperative (joint action) have, however, clear (often lexicalized) semantic profiles of their own, while only the pluritative (plural action) may be seen as a candidate for a true plural form of the verb. Certainly, the pluritative cannot be combined with a singular subject, which means that its use may be seen as an agreement phenomenon. On the other hand, its use is not obligatory, for it can always be replaced by the corresponding unmarked form”
